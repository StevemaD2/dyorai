# nextn ü§ñ‚õìÔ∏è

**nextn** (likely a combination of Next.js, AI, and Web3) is a powerful tool that combines Artificial Intelligence with blockchain technologies to provide analysis and insights into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

## About the Project

This project was born from the need for smarter, more automated tools for crypto asset analysis. Using AI capabilities from Google's Genkit (`@genkit-ai/google-genai`) and Web3 integration via thirdweb (`@thirdweb-dev/react`), `nextn` offers [describe what it does, e.g., "market sentiment analysis," "smart contract audits," "project insights," etc.].

The application is built with Next.js and can be used as a web application.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Describe the types of analysis the AI performs.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Detail how it interacts with the blockchain (e.g., reading on-chain data, interacting with smart contracts via thirdweb).
*   **Wallet Management (if applicable):** Mention if there are wallet-related features, such as connecting different wallet types.
*   **Web Application:** A modern web interface built with Next.js and shadcn/ui.
