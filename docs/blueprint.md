# **App Name**: DyorAI

## Core Features:

- Wallet Connection: Enable users to connect their crypto wallets using Thirdweb SDK (project ID: ee9f28b57349df0047e49a8450a17599).
- AI Agent Integration: Integrate an AI agent represented by a 3D avatar that provides onboarding assistance and answers user queries related to crypto. Use a tool that helps the agent decide when or if the wallet is connected before deciding to incorporate any data about it into the answer.
- Contextual UI Updates: Update the user interface based on the wallet connection status, activating the 'Portfolio' section and AI agent interaction only after the wallet is connected.
- Welcome Content Display: Show welcome content and guides to new crypto users before they connect their wallet, educating them on the platform's purpose.
- Interactive Agent Placeholder: Create a placeholder for AI agent interaction (a simple input and output text box) since Convai/Eleven Labs is complex for a UI prompt.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pastel blue (#A7D1FF) to create a calm and trustworthy atmosphere.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a subtle and neutral backdrop that ensures legibility.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#C0A7FF) to highlight interactive elements such as the 'Connect Wallet' button, while remaining consistent with the peaceful aesthetic.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif font for a modern and fashionable look.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font providing a balance of modernity and warmth for readability.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent navigation items and crypto-related elements.
- Divide the layout vertically into three sections: a narrow left sidebar, a wider central content area, and a right sidebar for the AI agent.
- Incorporate subtle animations when transitioning between UI states, like connecting a wallet.
